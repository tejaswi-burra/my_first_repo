Name: Tejaswi
Course:BCA
Today, I learned the basics of using GitHub. I created a new repository, added a new file, 
and explored how to use Git commands to track changes.
I also learned how to create and edit files directly from the GitHub interface.
This gave me a good understanding of managing code and version control using GitHub.
